- name: Image2Knotwork Generator
  gh_user: Eslsamu
  repo: FreeformCelticKnotwork
  img: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eslsamu/FreeformCelticKnotwork/master/tree.png
  desc: Generative art and research project. The software converts objects on images into Celtic style knotwork. It uses techniques from computational geometry to fit a mesh structure into a region and optimizes it for regularity and symmetry. A thread is woven over the edges of this mesh structure to generate the knotwork. The code was written completely in Python.

- name: Quadrupedal Locomotion
  gh_user: Eslsamu
  repo: MarbleBot
  img: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eslsamu/MarbleBot/master/ghostdog.png
  desc: Research project on learning algorithms for quadrupedal locomotion. Implemented deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO and a parellel simulation pipeline for the WeBots simulator.

- name: Minigolf 
  gh_user: Eslsamu
  repo: 3DMinigolf
  img: https://i.ibb.co/nzV0NsN/golf.gif
  desc: A minigolf game with terrain editor and AI player. A combination of A-Star search and optimization methods let's the A.I hit hole-in-one on slopy greens and maze like courses. Implemented in Java with JavaFX.

- name: CargoLoad
  gh_user: Eslsamu
  repo: CargoLoad
